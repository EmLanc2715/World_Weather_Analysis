# World_Weather_Analysis

##Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to improve a new app called PlanMyTrip. I was tasked with adding features that Beta testers recommended after the initial launch. Specifically, they asked for the weather description to be added. Input statements were also added so that users can filter data based on their desired maximum and minimum temperature preferences. This added information will better help users identify potential travel destinations and hotels. 

We created an example of how PlanMyTrip would work with desired max temp of 85 and a min temp of 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The criteria given was then used to select 4 cities in the same country (Mexico), with the specified temperature preferences. Using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route was created to show the best way to drive between the 4 cities. A marker map was also created with the city name and name of the closest hotels.
